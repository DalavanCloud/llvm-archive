# This script allows LLVM modules to be checked out, configured and built all in
# one step.  Use it like this:
#
#    cd llvm-top
#    ./build {module_names} {configure_options} {build_options}
#
# where:
#    {module_names} is a list of modules you want to configure (e.g. llvm, hlvm)
#    {configure_options} start with -- and are passed to the configure tool
#      of *all* the modules you are building that need configuration.
#    {build_options} contain an = and are passed to the build tool of *all*
#      the modules you are building.
#
# Note that the script will checkout and configure any dependent modules as well
# as the ones specified in {module_names} so it is only necessary to specify the
# minimal set you're interested in.

# Get the library code
. ./library.sh

# Process the arguments so that anything starting with - is passed down to the
# configure scripts while anything else is a module name. Collect the arguments
# in appropriate variables for later use.
process_arguments "$@"

# Get (and possibly check out) the set of modules and their dependencies. This
# sets the MODULE_DEPENDENCIES variable to the set of module names that should
# be configured, in the correct order (least dependent first, no duplicates).
get_module_dependencies $MODULES

# Build a list of the static build options we'll pass to the modules
build_args="LLVM_TOP=$LLVM_TOP PREFIX=$PREFIX DESTDIR=$DESTDIR VERBOSE=$VERBOSE"
build_args="$build_args $OPTIONS_DASH $OPTIONS_DASH_DASH $OPTIONS_ASSIGN"

# Now that we have a list of dependent modules, we must configure each of them
# according to the specifications of the module.
for mod in $MODULE_DEPENDENCIES ; do
  build_a_module "$mod"
done

# Just indicate what modules we configured
